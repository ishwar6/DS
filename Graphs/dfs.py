# In Graph theory, the depth-first search algorithm is mainly used to:

# Traverse all vertices in a “graph”;
# Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a “graph”.

# DFS: IJ TRICK: USE DS(STACK); Time Complexity: O(V + E).Space Complexity: O(V) (stack(manually created or from recursion) stores V vertices)


# defaultdict
